# Company-wise LeetCode Website

This repository hosts the code for the Company-wise LeetCode Website, a tool that provides access to LeetCode interview questions from over 100 companies sorted by frequency and difficulty. The website categorizes questions based on their timeline (last 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years) and is based on data provided in the repo: [LeetCode Questions Company Wise](https://github.com/krishnadey30/LeetCode-Questions-CompanyWise.git).

## Features
- Filter questions by difficulty.
- Sort questions by frequency of appearance and difficulty.
- Access company-specific questions.
- Search by LeetCode ID to discover company-specific frequency data.
- Use checkboxes to track attempted questions without needing to log in.
- Monitor your solving trend over time with the Analysis button, which shows metrics like the number of problems solved over the past week or month and identifies peak productivity hours.
- Easily integrate new problems into the platform using the Add feature. Review your contributions by selecting Summary under the Add option.
